#You are given two classes, Person and Student, where Person is the base class and Student is the derived class. 
#Completed code for Person and a declaration for Student are provided for you in the editor. Observe that Student inherits all the properties of Person.

#Complete the Student class by writing the following:
#A Student class constructor, which has 4 parameters:
#- A string, firstName
#- A string, lastName
# An integer, id
#An integer array (or vector) of test scores, scores

#A char calculate() method that calculates a Student object's average and returns the grade 
#character representative of their calculated average:
#A | 90-100
#B | 80-89
#C | 70-79
#D | 60-69
#F | <60
