**Exercise 1:** In mathematics, the quadratic equation ax2+bx+c=0 can be solved with the formula x=−b±b2−4ac√2a.

Write a function solve_quadratic, that returns both solutions of a generic quadratic as a pair (2-tuple) when the coefficients are given as parameters. It should work like this:


```{python}
import math
def solve_quatratic(a,b,c):
    s1 = (-b + math.sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c ))/(2*a)
    s2 = (-b - math.sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c))/(2*a)
    return tuple(s1,s2)
```

**Exercise 2:** Get a space-separated list of integers from the user, create a tuple of those integers. Then compute and print the result of hash(tuple).
```{python}
l =input("Enter a space-separated list of integers: ")
l=l.split()
list_int=[]
for i in range(len(l)):
  list_int.append(int(l[i]))
print("The list of integers: ")
print(list_int)
#hash(tuple(l))
#i was getting a different hash number w/out elements as int's
print(" ")
print("Hash # of the Tuple of the List of Integers: ")
hash(tuple(list_int))
```


**Exercise 3:** Take the following two lists. Create a third list by picking a odd-index elements from the first list and even-index elements from the second.

```{python}
listOne = [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21]
listTwo = [4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28]
listThree = listOne[0:: 2] + listTwo[1:: 2]
print(listThree)
```

**Exercise 4:** Take the following list. Slice it into three equal chunks and reverse each list.
```{python}
sampleList = [11, 45, 8, 23, 14, 12, 78, 45, 89]
#print((len(sampleList)/3))
l_1= sampleList[0:4]; l_2 = sampleList[4:8]; l_3 = sampleList[8:]
print("The sample list divided into three: ")
print(l_1, l_2, l_2)
l_1.reverse()
l_2.reverse()
l_3.reverse()
print(" ")
print("The three lists with element order reversed: ")
print(l_1, l_2, l_2)
```

**Exercise 5:** Iterate through a given list and check if a given element already exists in a dictionary as a key's value. If not, delete it from the list.
```{python}
rollNumber = [47, 64, 69, 37, 76, 83, 95, 97]
sampleDict ={'Zach':47, 'Emma':69, 'Kelly':76, 'Jason':97}
vals = list(sampleDict.values())
rollNumber = list(set(rollNumber) & set(vals))
rollNumber.sort()
print("A list of integers present in the initial list that intersects with the dictionary's values: ")
print(rollNumber)
```
